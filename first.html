        <p>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was one of the few student leaders who played a significant role in turning the language movement into a mass movement. As a student leader, he was the central figure in organizing mass gatherings, rallies and strikes for raising awareness against the discriminatory language policy of pakistan. The language movement started when the Governer General of Pakistan, Mujammad Ali Jinnah, declared"Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistn" on 19 March 1948 at the Racecourse Maidan while addressing a public gathering. He again uttered the same on 24 March 1948 at the university of Dhaka during hin convocation speech. The students instantly protested against this announcement vehemently.</p>

        <p>It was the time when young Mujib started organizing the student front of Muslim League in East pakisthan. He was proud of his Bengali identity and very active to initiate strikes and protests against the language policy of Pakistan government. Later, the then Prime Minister of Pakistan Khwaja Nazimuddin echoed the statement of Mr. Jinnah on 26 January,1952. Mujib was in prison during this time due to his political activism and was admitted to the Dhaka MEdical College under police custody. However, he stayed in constant touch with other leaders directly engaged in the movement to make Bangla the state language. His directions from prison led the movement to a success. On 14 February, He started a hunger strike there. During a general strike on 21 February, 1952 the protesting students tried to defy Section 144 imposed by the government. The police opened fire and killed a number of students including Abdus Salam, Rafiq Uddin Ahmed, Abul Barkat, Abdul Jabbar and others. In his autobiography, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman says "... <i>We decided in the meeting in my room to observe 21 February as State Language Day and to from a commitee that day to conduct the movement to establish Bengali as the state language.</i> "</p>
